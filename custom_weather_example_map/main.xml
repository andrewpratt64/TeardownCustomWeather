<!--
This is the Create Castle level file. It sets the size of the level, what environment to use and all objects, such as vox-models, scripts and boundary, used in the level.
Positions are given in meters relative to their parent objects position. In this level no objects are parented and hence positions are in reference to the bottom center of the game world.
Sizes are given in voxels. One voxel is 0.1 meters on all sides.
The Castle model was made by @knosvoxel

<!--
The 'version' indicates what version of the editor was used to create the level. Leave it as is to make sure scripts are loaded as expected.
The 'shadowVolume' property sets the area of the game where lighting, and subsequently shadows, are calculated. It is expressed in meters; width, height, length
-->
<scene version="3" shadowVolume="200 100 200">
	<!-- 
	This sets the environment used for the level.
	The 'template' property references a predefined setup of environments. Available environment templates are: 'sunny', 'night', 'sunset', 'sunrise', 'foggy', and 'rain'
	The 'skyboxrot' sets the rotation of the skybox around the y axis, affecting the direction of the sun light. Explicitly set properties like this overrides the properties in the template. 
	-->
	<environment template="sunny" skyboxrot="30"/>

		A voxbox is a basic box shape. By default it is indestructible.
		The 'pos' property sets the position of the box's top-upper-left corner relative to the bottom center of the game world, in meters. 
		The 'size' property sets the size of the box in voxels as; width, height, and length.

		A vox is a voxel model loaded from a vox-file.
		The 'pos' property sets it's position relative to the bottom center of the game world, in meters.
		The 'texure' property is used to apply one of the available textures. The first value, to the left of the space, is the index for the wanted texture. The textures can be found in the 'data/gfx/albedo.png' file in the installation folder. The top left white texture is number 0. The second value, to the right of the space, indicates how strong the texture should be applied in the range 0.0 - 1.0. 
		The 'file' property references the vox-file to be loaded. The 'LEVEL' keyword is a reference to the folder with the same name as the level file i.e., The keyword 'LEVEL' in the basic.xml level file (this file) references the folder named 'basic'.

		These vertices defines the boundary of the game level.
		The 'pos' property sets the position of the vertex relative to the bottom center of the game world, in meters. As the boundary has infinite height the positions are only given relative to width and length, without height.

	This loads and runs the referenced script when the level starts.
	The 'file' property is the reference to which script should be loaded and run. Since this file reference is not preceded by 'LEVEL/' it is loaded from the 'data/script' folder in the installation folder.
